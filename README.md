I wrote this little app back in 2011 as a way to prove a point about apps. The point was that animation can make your app feel alive, and a bit more human. It also makes it more fun.

And so in that regard, I made a garage door opening, an explosive checkmark, an ease-in-out logo, and a blow torch when you tap and hold.

Imagine a world where that to-do list item you just checked off explodes with the force of an Arnold Schwarzenegger grenade launcher. Or where secret treasure is hidden behind locked doors. Or where you don't just push a boring button, but it springs to life as a character from a story.

That, my friends, is the future of software.
